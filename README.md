Excuse this lousy repo, this is for scripts and is not refined or well-documented

This repo contains a few scripts for deleting .html files, renaming .html files, and converting .html files to .pdf with an image intermediary

Requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install wkhtmltopdf 

If you run into issues it is likely due to libararies of PATHs. 

Check for file names during the renaming of HTML files as "/" and other characters will cause issues

Ideally these scripts could be combined to do a rename and a file conversion from .html to .pdf all in one script
